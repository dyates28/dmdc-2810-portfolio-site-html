                            <p>
                                Hello my name is Darren, and I am the Average Dad.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The number one way that I want to spend my time is with my family. That being said as far as a career goes, I want to do something that I enjoy and that is meaningful to me. I enjoy being creative and being around others that are creative. And if I can do something that I enjoy and be around others of a similar mindset, I can then even more enjoy the time I have with my family.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As I pursue a career in Web and Graphic design, I am excited to see where it takes me. I am also excited to continue my education. I want to work with other creatives and learn from them to become a better designer, professional and person.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From my studies in my Undergrad, I have a strong understanding of how communication affects all of us. I am a huge advocate for positive and uplifting communication and am excited to push that kind of communication the different mediums graphic design has to offer.
                            </p>
